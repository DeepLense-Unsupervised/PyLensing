This directory contains modules for generating strong lensing images based on PyAutoLens simulations. These modules could be helpful for tasks such as Machine Learning that require a large number of samples for a particular lensing configuration.

Currently supported lensing configurations:

* Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing

* Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing with vortex substructure

* Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing with Spherical substructure
